Java - Java is a programming language and a platform.    Platform because it provides RUNTIME ENVIORNMENT and API. Language because it provides syntax.
Data type - a)Primitive 8 - byte,short,int,long float,double char(default-value-\u0000) boolean b) Non primitive - Array,String
Unicode system (UTF - 8)(4 bytes per characters) all language - java  ;   ASCII - only englist - 128 characters
Common Java Programs - Fibonnaci, Prime number, Palindrome, Factorial , Armstrong

Socket : ServerSocket and ClientSocket
Create object of ServerSocket and accept it to get the socket. readUTF the data from socket's DataInputStream  *UTF means Unicode
Client does NOT have to create any object of itself. Just create a socket with IP address and port number of server. Get DataOutputStream of socket and writeUTF and flush to it
URL class : protocol, host address , port, file name
URLConnection class : to get Data from specific Url
HttpUrlConnection : to get header information
InetAddress : to get host ip address and host name

Design Pattern  : Creational : Structural : Behavioral
Factory Pattern  : Creational
Builder : Creational
Singleton : Creational
Adapter : Builder

Collections :
ArrayList and LinkedList : Arraylist is used when to access data while LinkedList when to add or remove data. Because in linked list its easier to remove or add while in array its easier to traverse.

Multithreading : 5 states : New, Runnable, Running , Non-Runnable, Terminated
Two ways of implementing by : extending Thread or implementing Runnable interface.
Only one thread can run in a process at a time. Thread Scheduler : Priority based(Preemtive) or Time Slicing
sleep method 
If we directly call run() instead of start(), no new call stack will be created. It will not behave like a different thread.
Join method : stops every other thread until the thread on which join is called is finished.
setName()
Priority : Max : 10 ; Default : 5 ; Min :1
Daemon thread : worker thread for user thread : set a thread user thread by calling setDaemon(true) on it
Thread Pool
Thread Group : Used to terminate or interrupt a group of thread in one call. ThreadGroup can be specified in the constructor of thread.
Shutdown hook : used to do a task during shutdown or ctrl+c. Called by Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new thread())
Garbage collector : manually call by : System.gc() : called on a) unreference object e.g. new Thread() b) by nulling a reference c) by assigning to other
Java Runtime class is used to interact with java runtime environment. Java Runtime class provides methods to execute a process, invoke GC, get total and free memory etc. e.g Runtime.getRuntime().exec("notepad")

Synchronization :
Method Synchronization : by putting synchronized keyword before any method
Block Synchronization : by putting the block inside synchronized(this) keyword or using synchronized(variable name)
Deadlock
intercommunication between thread : wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
Interrupt thread : to wake a thread from sleep e.g. t1.interrupt()

Swing :
The Java Foundation Classes (JFC) are a set of GUI components which simplify the development of desktop applications.
There are two ways to create a frame: a)By creating the object of Frame class (association) b) By extending Frame class (inheritance)
Button : JButton(), JButton(String s), JButton(icon i)
RadioButton : JRadioButton(), JRadioButton(String s), JRadioButton(String s, boolean selected)
ButtonGroup : ButtonGroup()
JTextArea
JCombobBox : Dropdown list
JTable
JColorChooser
JProgressBar
JSlider
Graphics : extend Canvas : inside paint function : drawRect(), drawLine() etc.
Image : extend Canvas
Menu : JMenuBar, JMenuFile, JMenuItem
JFileChooser
BorderLayout : North, South, East, West, Centre
GridLayout
FlowLayout
Box Layout
Card Layout
