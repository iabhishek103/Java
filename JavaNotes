Java - Java is a programming language and a platform.    Platform because it provides RUNTIME ENVIORNMENT and API. Language because it provides syntax.
Data type - a)Primitive 8 - byte,short,int,long float,double char(default-value-\u0000) boolean b) Non primitive - Array,String
Unicode system (UTF - 8)(4 bytes per characters) all language - java  ;   ASCII - only englist - 128 characters
Common Java Programs - Fibonnaci, Prime number, Palindrome, Factorial , Armstrong

Socket : ServerSocket and ClientSocket
Create object of ServerSocket and accept it to get the socket. readUTF the data from socket's DataInputStream  *UTF means Unicode
Client does NOT have to create any object of itself. Just create a socket with IP address and port number of server. Get DataOutputStream of socket and writeUTF and flush to it
URL class : protocol, host address , port, file name
URLConnection class : to get Data from specific Url
HttpUrlConnection : to get header information
InetAddress : to get host ip address and host name

Design Pattern  : Creational : Structural : Behavioral
Factory Pattern  : Creational
Builder : Creational
Singleton : Creational

Collections :
ArrayList and LinkedList : Arraylist is used when to access data while LinkedList when to add or remove data. Because in linked list its easier to remove or add while in array its easier to traverse.

Multithreading : 5 states : New, Runnable, Running , Non-Runnable, Terminated
Two ways of implementing by : extending Thread or implementing Runnable interface.
Only one thread can run in a process at a time. Thread Scheduler : Priority based(Preemtive) or Time Slicing
sleep method 
If we directly call run() instead of start(), no new call stack will be created. It will not behave like a different thread.
Join method : stops every other thread until the thread on which join is called is finished.
